# haskell-playing

This repo is my private attempt to learn and to become fluent in haskell.
I assume that you are using `stack` and have installed it.  You should also
fill in some information in your `~/.stack/config.yaml` file.  For example, I
did the following:
```    
templates:
  params:
    author-name: Mike Stillman
    author-email: mikestillman@my-confuscated-email.gmail.com
    copyright: Copyright by me
    github-username: mikestillman
    category: computational algebraic geometry
```        

Use `make setup` to do stack init, setup, and build.
    
Use `make distclean` to wipe out the files and directories generated
by `stack`

I will also record in this repo, for myself only, notes on using
stack, ghc, ghci, etc.
